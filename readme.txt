Dynamically build a page with simple shortcode based on hashed URL values.

== Description ==

Dynamically build a page with simple shortcode based on hashed URL values.

== Installation ==

1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
2. Use the plugin's shortcode [echo-hash param_name] in the content of your pages and posts, replacing 'param_name' with the name of the parameter you wish to display.
3. Use hashes in your URL to display their value in the page.

For instance, if your page URL is http://mysite.com/page/#name=John Doe/age=43, then 'John Doe' will be displayed wherever [echo-hash name] is inserted, and '43'  will be displayed wherever [echo-hash age] is inserted.
